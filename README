GrafX is a simple X11 graphics library meant to be easy to learn, and quick to use..
The goal is to pop up a X11 window, and draw some graphics in it.
GraphX runs only on linux using X11 windows, perhaps on Mac.


USAGE

1. Include the library 
	#include "grafX.h"

2. Create a window
	GrafX gx;
	gx.open(600, 400, "Test GrafX");
	// Where 600 is the width, 400 is the height and 
	// "Test GrafX" is the title of the window

3. Draw
	gx.line(x1, y1, x2, y2);
	gx.lineto(x, y);
	gx.rectangle(x, y width, height);
	gx.point(x, y);

4. Colors
	// set the pen color 
	gx.color(n_red, n_green, n_blue); 

4. Compile
	g++ grafX.o testGrafX.cpp -o testGrafX -std=c++11 -lX11
